# Alarm Clock
Welcome to the Alarm Clock project! This project was created as a task for my internship at Sync Interns. The project is a simple alarm clock application built with Python and Tkinter.

# Description
The Alarm Clock is a Python application with a graphical user interface that allows users to set an alarm and receive a notification when the alarm goes off. The application supports the following features:

* Setting an alarm time
* Setting a custom alarm message
* Playing a sound when the alarm goes off
* Snoozing the alarm for a set period of time
* Turning off the alarm
The Alarm Clock GUI was built using the Tkinter library, which provides a set of Python modules for creating graphical user interfaces. The application also uses the Pygame library to play alarm sounds.
